# Documentation Rules

## README Files in Every Directory

Every directory in the project must have a README.md file that:

- Describes the purpose and contents of the directory
- Explains how the components can be used
- Provides context for developers working with the code

When creating new code, these README files should be referenced to ensure consistency with existing patterns and to make code more human-readable and maintainable.

This rule ensures comprehensive documentation throughout the project structure and promotes better understanding of the codebase.
