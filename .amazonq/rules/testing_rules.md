# Testing Rules

## Unit Tests for All Endpoints

For every new API endpoint created in this project, unit tests must be automatically added without explicit request. Tests should:

- Verify the endpoint's functionality
- Include appropriate mocks for dependencies
- Test both success and error cases
- Achieve high code coverage

This rule ensures consistent test coverage across all API endpoints and maintains code quality as the project grows.
